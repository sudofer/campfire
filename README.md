# Campfire

Welcome to Campfire. During COVID, we found it difficult to connect with our friends online while staying safe at home. This is how the idea for Campfire was born. We wanted to build a platform that would allow people to connect online, by making sure that people had a warm and cozy place to meet. Campfire allows friends to find, queue, and play YouTube videos while chatting together.
